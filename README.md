Necronomicoin
=============

Print your own token for communing with Great Old Ones! I designed
these as tokens for a 2011 Halloween party. Edge is higher than the
symbol to reduce wear and tear.

Instructions
------------

I printed this on a Makergear Mosaic with:
* 0.25 mm layer thickness
* 0.4 mm line thickness
* 1.0 infill
* 0 extra shells

I used Multiply to print 9 at once.

Firmware without lookahead acceleration (Sprinter vs. Marlin) produced
an interesting effect: pronounced edges at each corner of the outer
cylinder. This gave them an old school character.

Text object created with text2surface, and polygons reduced with
Meshlab. Necronomicon symbol created in QCAD.
